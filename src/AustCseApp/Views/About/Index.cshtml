                        Welcome to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST).
                        On behalf of the faculty and staff of the CSE department, I would like to inform you that we are delighted and honored that you have
                        chosen to join us in pursuing your career in CSE. This is an exhilarating time in CSE and Information Technology (IT), both here at
                        AUST and throughout the world. You are enrolling in an astonishingly dynamic field in which you can explore some of the world’s most
                        pressing challenges. Globally, we have seen substantial progress in computer applications like social communication, industrial
                        automation, software development, and notable improvements in artificial intelligence. However, some significant approaches, such as
                        speech synthesis, medical image computing, natural language processing, cybersecurity, mixed reality, etc. are progressing towards
                        environmental sustainability with the vision of a better world. This means that there are great opportunities for you to learn about
                        these problems and technologies and help develop solutions with our faculty members.
